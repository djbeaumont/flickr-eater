# Flickr Eater

This demo project retrieves photos from [Flickr's JSON API](https://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?format=json)
and displays them in a single-page-application written using AngularJS.

## Demo

This project is available on my [github page](https://djbeaumont.github.io/flickr-eater/).

## TODO

### Must Haves

* ~~Setup git repository~~
* ~~Find hosting~~
* ~~Link to image from title~~
* ~~Show and link to author~~
* ~~Show tags~~
* ~~Limit size of title~~
* ~~Limit size of image~~
* ~~Limit size of tag lists~~
* ~~Handle API failures gracefully~~
* ~~Show description~~ - it doesn't seem to contain anything more than 'X posted a photo'
