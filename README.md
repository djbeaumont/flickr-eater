# Flickr Eater

This demo project retrieves photos from [Flickr's JSON API](https://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?format=json)
and displays them in a single-page-application written using AngularJS.

## Demo

This project is available on my [github page](https://djbeaumont.github.io/flickr-eater/).

## TODO

### Must Haves

* ~~Setup git repository~~
* ~~Find hosting~~
* Build scripts
* Jasmine tests
* ~~Show description~~ - NOT REQUIRED - it doesn't contain anything more than 'X posted a photo'
* ~~Link to image from title~~
* ~~Show and link to author~~
* ~~Show tags~~
* Handle API failures gracefully
* Limit size of title
* Limit size of image
* Limit size of tag lists

### Should Haves

* Refactor into directives
* Silhouette image for loading pictures
* Spinner animation for loading pictures
* Infinite scroll
* Tag search

### Nice to Haves

* Use full screen api to show image (requires API key)
